Hello, my name is Andrew Glenn. I am a PhD student at Penn State studying aerospace engineering. My research focus is astrodynamics in cislunar space. I am a member of the Astrodynamics Research Groups of Penn State [ARGoPS](https://argops.psu.edu/). I am interested in the quantification of uncertainty for spacecraft in cislunar space.

This page seeks to showcase my work and link to papers, presentations, and code.
